 ## Inspiration
Starting out as freshman in college a year ago we realized that we did not have a lot of time to spare and found ourselves really busy. At the same time we all wanted to dress good and go to classes. Selecting the correct outfit takes a lot of time and effort and most people do not find the time to do so. They want to look good but also do not want to spend too much time. In order, to reduce the time they would have to spend we automated the process of matching the top and bottom leading to them being able to check how their outfit looks by just swiping through the available options and without having to wear it physically. The time saved can be used for other activities on the college campus.


## What it does
The application functions as a virtual wardrobe, where you can upload images of your own clothes, (currently supporting tops and bottoms for men), where you can mix and match clothes to find the style that suits you the best for the occasion and weather. Having a huge wardrobe can be difficult to find the proper clothes that go together, so this application can be used to quickly and efficiently find the pairs of clothes that go well together so you can go on the rest of your day without a worry for how you stand out with respect to social norms, especially when you lack fashionable knowledge. 


## How I built it
We used the cross platform mobile development framework Flutter and programming language of dart. Additionally we used the image_picker, gallery_saver, and camera plugins offered by dart in our app.


## Challenges I ran into
Due to the steep learning curve we had to face, we ran into many roadblocks. Integrating the camera, saving the image into the phone gallery and calling the folder path to display the individual images on the user interface were the few main challenges we faced.


## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We managed to teach ourselves camera integration in flutter and apply it for our app. In a span of two days we went from having beginner level skills in the flutter framework to intermediate level skills. Lasty, we are also proud of being good team players and team leaders.


## What I learned
Considering most of our team didn’t know anything about flutter we learned how to use the Flutter SDK and the Dart programming language especially their plugins. We have also learned how to navigate the Visual Studio Code and Android Studio IDEs as well as collaborate on Github by making multiple branches. 
Apart from the technical skills, we learned team coordination, team leadership and gained communication skills.


## What's next for StyleMe
In the immediate future we plan on adding more room for other clothing accessories such as shoes, hats, etc and add a functionality to take in the height, weight, and skin tone of the person.
We would also like to add the feature to share the outfit to friends and receive from them. This also gives us the opportunity to set up achievements based on the number of likes and outfits the person makes and sets up friendly competition.
Another significant feature that we would like to add to the application in the future would be dirty clothing analysis. If you choose the option to select a pair of clothes, then the option automatically gets stored away, representing the clothes to be “dirty.” Once the user has done his actual laundry, they have the option to restock their entire wardrobe. 
Another interesting feature we would like to add is the on-the-go option, giving the user the opportunity to take a picture of any item of clothing that they see in a store and match with their existing wardrobe to see if it matches, this helps them make a decision to buy it or not.
The next tier of our application would be adding image detection and clothing recommendation code that will depend on machine learning and will recommend pre-made outfits to the user based on their current wardrobe.
Lastly, we plan to use this same algorithm to recommend more articles of clothing for the user to buy based on their current wardrobe and style trends
